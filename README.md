## Python Project
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a great way to analyze and visualize data. For this project, you can use Jupyter notebooks along with popular Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization. Let's break down the project into steps:

### Project Idea: World Population EDA using Jupyter Notebook

**Objective:** Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis on the world population dataset.

**Steps:**

1. **Import Libraries:**
   - Import necessary libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

2. **Load Data:**
   - Load the world population dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

3. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values (if any).
   - Check and clean data types.

4. **Basic Statistics:**
   - Compute and visualize basic statistics such as total population, average population, and growth rate.

5. **Continent-wise Analysis:**
   - Explore population statistics for each continent using visualizations like bar plots or pie charts.

6. **Top 10 Countries:**
   - Identify and visualize the top 10 countries based on population using bar charts.

7. **Population Growth Visualization:**
   - Use line plots or bar charts to visualize the population growth over the years for a selected country.

**Implementation:**

- Open a new Jupyter notebook (`World_Population_EDA.ipynb`) and start implementing the steps mentioned above.
- Use Markdown cells for documentation and explaining each step.
- Utilize code cells for writing Python code to load data, perform analysis, and visualize results.



This project will help beginners get hands-on experience with Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Jupyter notebooks for interactive data analysis. As they progress, they can explore more advanced analysis techniques and visualization tools.


## SQL Case Study - Paintings Documentation

### Objective:
The objective of this SQL case study is to analyze a dataset related to paintings and museums, perform various queries, and extract valuable insights from the data. The dataset comprises multiple tables containing information about paintings, museums, artists, and more. The case study includes a set of problem statements ranging from basic data retrieval to more complex data analysis and manipulation tasks.

### Dataset Description:
The dataset consists of several tables:
1. **Paintings:** Contains information about various paintings including their names, artists, regular prices, asking prices, etc.
2. **Museums:** Holds data regarding museums such as their names, locations (city, state, country), and operating hours.
3. **Artists:** Provides details about the artists who created the paintings, including their names and nationalities.
4. **Product_Size:** Contains information about the size and cost of different canvas sizes used for the paintings.
5. **Subject:** Includes data related to the subjects of the paintings.
6. **Image_Link:** Stores URLs linking to images of the paintings.
7. **Museum_Hours:** Records the operating hours of museums.

### Problem Statements:
The case study presents 22 problem statements, each requiring different SQL queries to extract relevant information from the dataset. These statements cover a wide range of tasks including data retrieval, data cleaning, aggregation, and complex analysis. Some examples of problem statements include identifying paintings not displayed in any museum, finding museums with invalid city information, determining the most popular artists and painting styles, etc.

### Execution Instructions:
1. **Loading the Dataset:** Before starting the analysis, students need to load the provided CSV files into a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.
2. **Running SQL Queries:** Students will execute SQL queries corresponding to each problem statement against the loaded database to obtain the desired results.
3. **Analysis and Interpretation:** After executing the queries, students should analyze the results to draw meaningful insights from the dataset. They may need to interpret the findings and provide explanations for the observed trends or patterns.

### Deliverables:
Students are expected to submit:
1. SQL queries written for each problem statement.
2. Resultant datasets or output generated by executing the queries.
3. Analysis and interpretations of the obtained results, including any observations, trends, or insights discovered from the data.

### Conclusion:
This SQL case study offers students an opportunity to apply their SQL querying skills to a real-world dataset. By working through the provided problem statements, students can gain proficiency in querying, analyzing, and interpreting data stored in a relational database, which is essential for various data-related roles in the industry.


## Power BI Use Case: Analysis of Paintings and Museums Data

## Objective:
The objective of this Power BI project is to analyze a dataset containing information about paintings, museums, artists, and related attributes. The project aims to derive insights such as the distribution of paintings across museums, the popularity of artists and painting styles, pricing trends, and more.

## Data Sources:
The dataset comprises multiple CSV files:
1. Paintings.csv
2. Museums.csv
3. Artists.csv
4. Product_Size.csv
5. Subject.csv
6. Image_Link.csv
7. Museum_Hours.csv

## Data Loading and Preparation:
1. Load the dataset CSV files into Power BI Desktop.
2. Create relationships between the tables based on relevant keys such as Painting ID, Museum ID, and Artist ID.
3. Perform data cleaning operations to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format columns as required.

## Analysis and Visualization:

1. **Painting Distribution by Museum:**

   - Analyze which museums host the most and least number of paintings.

2. **Artist Popularity:**
   - Build a bar chart or pie chart to visualize the distribution of paintings by each artist.
   - Identify the most prolific artists with the highest number of paintings in the dataset.

3. **Painting Style Distribution:**
   - Create a pie chart or bar chart to show the distribution of painting styles (e.g., landscape, portrait, abstract).
   - Analyze the popularity of different painting styles among museums and collectors.

4. **Price Analysis:**
   - Compare the asking prices and regular prices of paintings using a scatter plot or line chart.
   - Calculate the average, median, and range of prices to understand pricing trends in the dataset.

5. **Geographical Analysis:**
   - Use a map visualization to display the geographical distribution of museums.
   - Analyze which regions or countries have the highest concentration of museums.

6. **Subject Analysis:**
   - Create a bar chart or word cloud to visualize the most common painting subjects.
   - Identify popular themes and motifs depicted in the paintings.

7. **Museum Operating Hours:**
   - Analyze museum operating hours to identify patterns in opening and closing times.
   - Determine which museums have the longest and shortest operating hours.

8. **Sales Performance:**
   - Calculate total sales revenue by multiplying the number of paintings sold by their respective prices.
   - Compare sales performance across museums, artists, and painting styles.

9. **Canvas Size Analysis:**
