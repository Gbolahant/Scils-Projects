## Excel Project 
Use the Dataset excel project 

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to leverage Excel skills to analyze and visualize a dataset containing customer information. The dataset includes various attributes such as marital status, gender, income, education, occupation, and purchase behavior related to bike acquisition. The goal is to gain insights into the customer demographics and identify potential patterns or trends that can inform business decisions.

### Potential Analysis:
1. Identify patterns in customer demographics that may influence bike purchases.
2. Gain insights into regional variations in customer characteristics.
3. valuate the impact of education and age on bike purchases.

### Conclusion:
This project provides a practical opportunity for a student to apply Excel skills in a real-world scenario. It covers data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and visualization techniques, offering a holistic understanding of customer data analysis. The insights gained from this analysis can be valuable for businesses in making informed marketing and sales decisions.


## Python Project
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a great way to analyze and visualize data. For this project, you can use Jupyter notebooks along with popular Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization. Let's break down the project into steps:

### Project Idea: World Population EDA using Jupyter Notebook

**Objective:** Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis on the world population dataset.

**Steps:**

1. **Import Libraries:**
   - Import necessary libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

2. **Load Data:**
   - Load the world population dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

3. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values (if any).
   - Check and clean data types.

4. **Basic Statistics:**
   - Compute and visualize basic statistics such as total population, average population, and growth rate.

5. **Continent-wise Analysis:**
   - Explore population statistics for each continent using visualizations like bar plots or pie charts.

6. **Top 10 Countries:**
   - Identify and visualize the top 10 countries based on population using bar charts.

7. **Population Growth Visualization:**
   - Use line plots or bar charts to visualize the population growth over the years for a selected country.

**Implementation:**

- Open a new Jupyter notebook (`World_Population_EDA.ipynb`) and start implementing the steps mentioned above.
- Use Markdown cells for documentation and explaining each step.
- Utilize code cells for writing Python code to load data, perform analysis, and visualize results.



This project will help beginners get hands-on experience with Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Jupyter notebooks for interactive data analysis. As they progress, they can explore more advanced analysis techniques and visualization tools.


## SQL Case Study - Paintings Documentation

### Objective:
The objective of this SQL case study is to analyze a dataset related to paintings and museums, perform various queries, and extract valuable insights from the data. The dataset comprises multiple tables containing information about paintings, museums, artists, and more. The case study includes a set of problem statements ranging from basic data retrieval to more complex data analysis and manipulation tasks.

### Dataset Description:
The dataset consists of several tables:
1. **Paintings:** Contains information about various paintings including their names, artists, regular prices, asking prices, etc.
2. **Museums:** Holds data regarding museums such as their names, locations (city, state, country), and operating hours.
3. **Artists:** Provides details about the artists who created the paintings, including their names and nationalities.
4. **Product_Size:** Contains information about the size and cost of different canvas sizes used for the paintings.
5. **Subject:** Includes data related to the subjects of the paintings.
6. **Image_Link:** Stores URLs linking to images of the paintings.
7. **Museum_Hours:** Records the operating hours of museums.

### Problem Statements:
The case study presents 22 problem statements, each requiring different SQL queries to extract relevant information from the dataset. These statements cover a wide range of tasks including data retrieval, data cleaning, aggregation, and complex analysis. Some examples of problem statements include identifying paintings not displayed in any museum, finding museums with invalid city information, determining the most popular artists and painting styles, etc.

### Execution Instructions:
1. **Loading the Dataset:** Before starting the analysis, students need to load the provided CSV files into a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.
2. **Running SQL Queries:** Students will execute SQL queries corresponding to each problem statement against the loaded database to obtain the desired results.
3. **Analysis and Interpretation:** After executing the queries, students should analyze the results to draw meaningful insights from the dataset. They may need to interpret the findings and provide explanations for the observed trends or patterns.

### Deliverables:
Students are expected to submit:
1. SQL queries written for each problem statement.
2. Resultant datasets or output generated by executing the queries.
3. Analysis and interpretations of the obtained results, including any observations, trends, or insights discovered from the data.

### Conclusion:
This SQL case study offers students an opportunity to apply their SQL querying skills to a real-world dataset. By working through the provided problem statements, students can gain proficiency in querying, analyzing, and interpreting data stored in a relational database, which is essential for various data-related roles in the industry.
